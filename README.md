# FreeFEM markdown figures

repository of figures from FreeFEM markdown examples.

It follows the architecture of the FreeFEM [examples/](https://github.com/FreeFem/FreeFem-sources/tree/master/examples) directory. Each markdown example has its own directory storing the figures included in the script.
